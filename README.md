# voron-2.4-350mm-FW-marlin-tested-
1. each function with the pin already inserted
2. each function of marlin already has the pin in here must be inserted directly into the board
3.the FW is already tested and works 100%
I have set the ideal speeds for my car. if you have any doubts I have problems contact me, I spent some time testing and configuring,
think I was launching the first beta of the FW and I didn't realize that I hadn't saved the whole job :( I lost 5 days of work
